# Small Blog with Next,js, Vercel and Sanity

This is a modified version of [Personal Website with Built-in Content Editing](https://www.sanity.io/templates/personal-website-with-built-in-content-editing). It uses [Next.js][nextjs] for the frontend and [Sanity][sanity-homepage] to handle its content and has been deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).
